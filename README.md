# Text To Math Problem Solver And Data Search Assistant

This application is built using **Streamlit**, **Langchain**, and **SymPy**, designed to help users solve mathematical problems and retrieve data from the web. It offers:
1. Algebraic equation solving
2. Arithmetic calculations
3. Logic-based and reasoning problem solving
4. Wikipedia-based data retrieval

This app leverages the **Groq AI** model (Gemma2-9b-It) for logic-based reasoning and also uses a custom solver for math-related queries.

## Features
- **Algebraic Solver**: Solve equations like `2x + 5 = 11` and get the value of unknown variables.
- **Arithmetic Calculator**: Perform simple arithmetic operations such as `23 * 23` or `45 / 5`.
- **Data Search**: Use Wikipedia to fetch data on various topics.
- **Reasoning Agent**: Handles reasoning and logic-based questions with step-by-step explanations.

## Prerequisites
To run this app, you'll need the following installed on your system:
- Python 3.8+
- Streamlit
- Langchain
- SymPy
- Groq API key

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/text-to-math-problem-solver.git
    cd text-to-math-problem-solver
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**:

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3. **Install the required dependencies**:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Set up your Groq API Key**:

    You will need a Groq API Key to run the app. Get the key from [Groq's official website](https://www.groq.com/) and save it for later use in the app.

## Running the App

To start the Streamlit app:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## Usage

1. Open the app in your browser using the link generated by Streamlit.
2. Enter your **Groq API Key** in the input field.
3. Type a math question or a general query, such as:
   - **Algebraic equations**: "What is the value of x in the equation 2x + 5 = 11?"
   - **Arithmetic problems**: "What is 23 * 23?"
   - **Logic questions**: "What is the next number in the series 2, 4, 8, 16?"
   - **Wikipedia search**: "Who is Albert Einstein?"
4. Click the **"Find my answer"** button to get a solution or relevant information.

### `app.py`
The core code of the app where:
- **Groq AI** is used for advanced reasoning.
- **SymPy** solves algebraic and arithmetic equations.
- **Langchain** helps integrate Groq and other tools (like Wikipedia API) for logic-based and data-related queries.
  
## API Key Configuration

- The **Groq API Key** is mandatory for using the app. It is entered within the app interface for easy access.

## Tools and Libraries Used

- **Streamlit**: For building the UI of the app.
- **Langchain**: For chaining together various tools and the Groq model.
- **SymPy**: For solving algebraic equations and performing arithmetic operations.
- **Wikipedia API**: For data search and information retrieval.
- **Groq AI**: To leverage the power of AI for reasoning and logic-based questions.

## Sample Inputs

1. **Arithmetic**:  
   `23 * 23`
   
2. **Algebraic Equation**:  
   `2x + 5 = 11`
   
3. **Reasoning/Logic**:  
   `What is the next number in the series 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8?`
   
4. **Wikipedia Search**:  
   `Who is Marie Curie?`

## Future Enhancements
- Support for more complex mathematical problems including calculus and matrices.
- Integration of more advanced reasoning models for better logic-based question solving.
- Support for multi-step problem solving with more detailed explanations.
